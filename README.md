## 📚 About

As part of my data engineering and analytics learning path, I am exploring Snowflake's powerful features including:

- Schema and table creation
- Data staging and loading using internal stages
- SQL queries and transformations (joins, CTEs, window functions)
- Virtual warehouses and performance tuning
- Time travel, cloning, and role-based access control

The exercises and queries here are based on my course progress and personal experimentation.
