# ❄️ Snowflake Skills

This repository contains my hands-on work and assignments from my journey learning **Snowflake** — a modern cloud-based data warehousing platform. It includes SQL scripts, course exercises, and practical examples of warehouse setup, data loading, transformations, and queries.

## 📚 About

As part of my data engineering and analytics learning path, I am exploring Snowflake's powerful features including:

- Schema and table creation
- Data staging and loading using internal stages
- SQL queries and transformations (joins, CTEs, window functions)
- Virtual warehouses and performance tuning
- Data parsing and ETL 

The exercises and queries here are based on my course progress and personal experimentation.

## 🎓 Learning Badges
Alongside hands-on projects, I’ve earned several official Snowflake learning badges covering data warehousing, SQL, and platform features.
